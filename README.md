# Vimeo Coding Challenge
A coding challenge completed for Vimeo's Summer 2019 Front-End Engineering Internship! It was completed using React, using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a template.

To run this code:
1. Clone this repo.
2. `cd` into the directory and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`, which should start a local server at `localhost:3000`.
